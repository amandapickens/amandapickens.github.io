		<p>The line, which began in 1997, focuses almost exclusively on mecha (robots) taken from various 70's/80's anime series, although the line has diverged from this on a number of occasions, most notably the release of several mecha from the mid-90's anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. More recently, the line has expanded further to include mecha from 70's Super Sentai and Tokusatsu series, such as the <strong>Battle Fever Robo</strong> from Battle Fever J and Leopardon from the Japanese TV adaptation of Spider-Man.</p>
